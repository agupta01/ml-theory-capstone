He chid the sistersWhen first they put the name of king upon me,And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,They hail’d him father to a line of kings:Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;Put rancours in the vessel of my peaceOnly for them; and mine eternal jewelGiven to the common enemy of man,To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—',\n",
